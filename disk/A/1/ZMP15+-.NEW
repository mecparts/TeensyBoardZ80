     Version 1.5+/- of ZMP now compiles and links with v3.09 of 
Hi Tech C and fixes a few things that had niggled at me for
awhile (some, a few decades):

* Datestamps transferred in Y/Zmodem transfers.
* Fixed long filename conversions on Y/Zmodem transfers.
* Fixed issues displaying baud rate and send times when the
  baud rate is > 19.2K.
* Removed superfluous CR sent to the remote end when a
  connection was established, which was a pita when connecting to
  a Linux box.
* In keyboard macros, ! translates to a CR now, not CR/LF.
* \ escapes ! and ~ so those literal characters can be used in
  keyboard macros.
* Waits in keyboard macros now allow characters from the modem to
  be handled.
* Keys in keyboard macros now have 25ms waits between them as to
  not overrun the remove system.
* Long distance access code has been removed.
* Quick dialing letters limited to A-T.

     This version, based on the version of the source code in
ZMP-SRC.LBR, is missing a few things that made it into the later
version in ZMP15.LBR. So, to quote the original author, 

"As always,  ensure that you erase your .CFG file and make a 
new one with the config option.  There have again been changes to 
the format of this file."
